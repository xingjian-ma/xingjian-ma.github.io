I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Connecticut, advised by Prof. Jun Yan and co-advised by Prof. Haiying Wang.
My research interests include rerandomization in experimental design, covariate-adaptive randomization designs, causal inference, and applications in clinical trials and social sciences.

Currently, I am working on:
- Theory and applications of rerandomization for complex experimental designs
- An R package for rerandomization-based design and analysis of experiments

You can find my [CV](/files/Xingjian_Ma_CV.pdf), publications, and software on the navigation bar above.
