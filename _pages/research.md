## Rerandomization
Jun 2025 – Present, Advised by Prof. Haiying Wang and Prof. Jun Yan

Rerandomization is an experimental design technique that improves covariate balance between treatment groups. I am working on:

- **A comprehensive review of rerandomization methodologies**, summarizing core theoretical developments from Morgan & Rubin (2012) to recent extensions (e.g., Li & Ding, Wang & Li, Branson et al.) and identifying open research questions in the field.
- **Addressing the adverse impact of high-dimensional covariates**, including developing strategies to mitigate high-dimensional imbalance and studying the associated statistical properties of rerandomization procedures.
- **Variable selection strategies** under rerandomization, aiming to identify principled methods for selecting influential covariates while maintaining validity and efficiency.
- **Development of a high-performance R package** for rerandomization-based design and analysis of experiments, incorporating recent theoretical advances and user-friendly functionalities.

## Emergency Department Census Forecasting
Aug 2024 – Jun 2025, Advised by Prof. Jun Yan

I collaborated with the Connecticut Children’s to develop accurate forecasting models for the pediatric emergency department (ED) census (defined as the number of patients present in the ED at any given hour). Key contributions include:

- **Developed a harmonic dynamic regression model with Fourier series** and an ARIMAX component to capture both seasonal cycles and short-term variations. External covariates (temperature, air quality, water data) were incorporated to enhance predictive accuracy.
- **Implemented a rolling forecast evaluation framework** to assess model performance over multiple forecast horizons, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to traditional time series models on both point and interval forecasts.

## Covariate-Adaptive Randomization
Mon 2023 – Jun 2024, Advised by Prof. Yang Liu

Covariate-adaptive randomization (CAR) is widely used in clinical trials to balance treatment groups with respect to important covariates. My research focuses on:

- **Improving CAR procedures for multi-arm clinical trials**, including proposing novel randomization schemes that enhance covariate balance while preserving randomization integrity.

- **Theoretical properties of CAR procedures**, including deriving asymptotic distributions of covariate imbalances under general multi-arm CAR designs with unequal allocation ratios.
